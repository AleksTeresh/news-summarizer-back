The death toll, reported by state media, rose repeatedly on Friday afternoon as more details emerged.\r\n\r\nA bomb ripped through the mosque as Friday prayers were finishing, then militants in four off-road vehicles approached and opened fire on worshippers, a military source told the Guardian.\r\n\r\nMore than 50 ambulances ferried casualties from al-Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, about 40km west of the city of Arish, to nearby hospitals. At least 130 people were injured.\r\n\r\nNo group claimed responsibility for the assault, but it was the deadliest yet in a region where for the past three years Egyptian security forces have battled an Islamic State insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, delivered a defiant television address hours after the attack in which he offered condolences to the families of victims.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis act will only increase our will and unity,\u201D he said. \u201CThe police and military will avenge our martyrs and restore peace and security.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe added: \u201CThis is our response. We will respond with brute force to combat these terrorists and deviants ... This is an attempt to deter us from fighting terrorism and to destroy our will, but we are steadfast, and I say to all Egyptians, the battle your are fighting is the most honourable.\u201D",
